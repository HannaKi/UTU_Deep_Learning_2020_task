# Image classification with a modern CNN

This is a coursework made in Turku University course Deep Learning. In the notebook I 
*  Build a data pipeline for Mobilenet neural network
*  Add input and output layers in the ready made network and use it for image classification
*  Inspect different kind of methods how to reduce the test error the network makes
*  Visualize and analyse the training and the results

This is a rather big ipynb file made in Colab with GPU runtime. If you struggle opening a view to it, I recommend refreshing the GitHub page.
